BOB structure 

  -GUI:
    - retractable console 
    - emotion animation
    - structure of an eye
    
  -GUI application:
    - question element : Input/Entry type of GUI element where you can ask BOB question:
        -- first step: textual comunication
        -- second step: text-to-speech and speech-to-text conversion representation in real time
        -- third step: hidden :> voice only 
    - response element: Text/Label type of GUI element where you can see BOBs response:
        -- first step: chat-bot formulation :> database of structured asnwears: 
            -> U: "What day it is?"
            -> BOB: "Friday, date,month,time"
        -- second step: Subject/Object differentiation in syntax. So BOB can be on topic.
        -- third step: Responce activity : give BOB a task, and BOB does it. 
            -> organisation :
            -> common boring stuff automation :
            -> scripting :
            -> time scheduling :
            -> miscelanious 
        -- forth step: text-to-speech representation of default text
        -- fifth step: hidden :> voice only 
    - emotion representation: 
        -- bit flags / emotion representation :
            -> Angry when failed
            -> for other emotions also

  -cross programs comunication:
    -GUI :> 
        ->eye, 
        ->console, 
    -BASE :> 
        ->organisation segment, 
        ->search segment, 
        ->automation, 
        ->scripting, 
        ->scheduling ...
    -IP/TCL :> comunication GUI-BASE
    -DataBase :> common phrase comunication and question syntax differentiation 
    -SPEECH syntesis :> 
        -> text2speech,
        -> speech2text,
        -> audio_modulation component
            => pre-sampled and pre-quantisized signal generators
            => function objects, inversable and differentiable 
            => AUDIO recognition AI, genetic neural network based upon neuron = genome:> n*genome = genes : n&neurones = fittness
        -> vocal database :>
            => alphabet sound data, // stored in binary form with no reading wave files. 
            => format genetic of sound data :> SSLLLLLLEEEEe byte form [ S - short start, L - vocal element , E - long ending element, e -- short ending element ]
            => byte indexing 
    - LOGGING :>

  -AI's:
    - Audio learning software :>
      -generates speach mimic software
